# AptosStockPortfolio

Hi Everyone! This is a quick project exercise that builds out a summary display for stock transactions.  The summary panel shows a starting stock portfolio and its worth.
Additionally the summary panel shows a desired stock portfolio and gives information about its worth, number of shares, and price per unit.
Beneath the summary panel, there is a panel that shows the transactions made to obtain the final portfolio and all of the respective metadata for 
each transaction.
